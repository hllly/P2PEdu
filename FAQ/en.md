## How to synchronize Tox ID between multiple devices?

Multidevice support is being [developed](https://github.com/GrayHatter/toxcore/tree/multi-device) and is not yet complete. For now you can export your .tox profile from one device and import it to another using the guides above.


## Why don't I receive push notifications in background?

Antidote works in background only for 10 minutes, after that it will be suspended by iOS. Unfortunately, now there is no way to extend this time.

However, we plan to support push notification in the future. Please stay tuned!


## Can I send message to offline contacts?

No, we don't support offline messaging yet.

As Antidote is a peer-to-peer application, both users should be online to send and receive messages. However, offline messaging will be available on Antidote once [Tox](https://tox.chat) starts supporting it.


## How to enable PIN and Touch ID?

You can protect your profile with PIN or Touch ID.
To do so:

1. Open `Profile` tab
2. Select `Profile Details`
3. Turn on `PIN Enabled` switch
4. Turn on `Touch ID Enabled` switch (if available).
